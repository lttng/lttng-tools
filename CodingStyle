LTTng-Tools Coding Style

The coding style used for this project follows the the Linux kernel
guide lines, except that brackets "{", "}" should typically be used even
for single-line if/else statements. Please refer to:

- Linux kernel Documentation/CodingStyle document for details,
- Linux kernel scripts/checkpatch.pl for a script which verify the patch
  coding style.
