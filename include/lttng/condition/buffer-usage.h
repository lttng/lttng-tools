/**
 * Buffer usage conditions allows an action to be taken whenever a channel's
 * buffer usage crosses a set threshold.
 *
 * These conditions are periodically evaluated against the current buffer
 * usage statistics. The period at which these conditions are evaluated is
 * governed by the channels' monitor timer.
 *
 * Note that the use of these conditons does not imply any hysteresis-loop
 * mechanism. For instance, an upper-bound buffer usage condition set to 75%
 * will fire everytime the buffer usage goes from a value < 75% to a value that
 * is >= 75%. The evaluation result does not depend on any lower-bound condition
 * being reached before the condition is evaluated to true again.
 *
 * Buffer usage conditions have the following properties:
 *   - the exact name of the session in which the channel to be monitored is
 *     defined,
 *   - the domain of the channel to be monitored,
 *   - the exact name of the channel to be monitored,
 *   - a usage threshold, expressed either in bytes or as a fraction of total
 *     buffer capacity.
 *
 * Wildcards, regular expressions or other globbing mechanisms are not supported
 * in buffer usage condition properties.
