 * The notification channel protocol is bidirectional and accomodates

 *
 *   - Synchronous: commands emitted by the client to which a reply is expected
 *     (e.g. subscribing/unsubscribing to conditions),
 *   - Asynchronous: notifications which are sent by the lttng_endpoint to the
 *     client as one of the subscribed condition has occurred.
 *
 * The nature of this hybrid communication mode means that asynchronous messages
 * (e.g. notifications) may be interleaved between synchronous messages (e.g. a
 * command and its reply).
 *
 * Notifications that are received between a command and its reply and enqueued
 * in the pending_notifications list.
