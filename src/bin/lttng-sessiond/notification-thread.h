/**
 * This thread maintains an internal state associating clients and triggers.
 *
 * In order to speed-up and simplify queries, hash tables providing the
 * following associations are maintained:
 *
 *   - client_socket_ht: associate a client's socket (fd) to its "struct client"
 *             This hash table owns the "struct client" which must thus be
 *             disposed-of on removal from the hash table.
 *
 *   - channel_triggers_ht:
 *             associates a channel key to a list of
 *             struct lttng_trigger_list_nodes. The triggers in this list are
 *             those that have conditions that apply to this channel.
 *             A channel entry is only created when a channel is added; the
 *             list of triggers applying to such a channel is built at that
 *             moment.
 *             This hash table owns the list, but not the triggers themselves.
 *
 *   - channel_state_ht:
 *             associates a pair (channel key, channel domain) to its last
 *             sampled state received from the consumer daemon
 *             (struct channel_state).
 *             This previous sample is kept to implement edge-triggered
 *             conditions as we need to detect the state transitions.
 *             This hash table owns the channel state.
 *
 *   - notification_trigger_clients_ht:
 *             associates notification-emitting triggers to clients
 *             (struct notification_client_list) subscribed to those
 *             conditions.
 *             The condition's hash and match functions are used directly since
 *             all triggers in this hash table have the "notify" action.
 *             This hash table holds no ownership.
 *
 *   - channels_ht:
 *             associates a channel_key to a struct channel_info. The hash table
 *             holds the ownership of the struct channel_info.
 *
 *   - sessions_ht:
 *             associates a session_name (hash) to a struct session_info. The
 *             hash table holds no ownership of the struct session_info;
 *             the session_info structure is owned by the session's various
 *             channels through their struct channel_info (ref-counting is used).
 *
 *   - triggers_ht:
 *             associates a condition to a struct lttng_trigger_ht_element.
 *             The hash table holds the ownership of the
 *             lttng_trigger_ht_elements along with the triggers themselves.
 *
 * The thread reacts to the following internal events:
 *   1) creation of a tracing channel,
 *   2) destruction of a tracing channel,
 *   3) registration of a trigger,
 *   4) unregistration of a trigger,
 *   5) reception of a channel monitor sample from the consumer daemon.
 *
 * Events specific to notification-emitting triggers:
 *   6) connection of a notification client,
 *   7) disconnection of a notification client,
 *   8) subscription of a client to a conditions' notifications,
 *   9) unsubscription of a client from a conditions' notifications,
 *
 *
 * 1) Creation of a tracing channel
 *    - notification_trigger_clients_ht is traversed to identify
 *      triggers which apply to this new channel,
 *      - triggers identified are added to the channel_triggers_ht.
 *    - add channel to channels_ht
 *
 * 2) Destruction of a tracing channel
 *    - remove entry from channel_triggers_ht, releasing the list wrapper and
 *      elements,
 *    - remove entry from the channel_state_ht.
 *    - remove channel from channels_ht
 *
 * 3) Registration of a trigger
 *    - if the trigger's action is of type "notify",
 *      - traverse the list of conditions of every client to build a list of
 *        clients which have to be notified when this trigger's condition is met,
 *        - add list of clients (even if it is empty) to the
 *          notification_trigger_clients_ht,
 *    - add trigger to channel_triggers_ht (if applicable),
 *    - add trigger to triggers_ht
 *    - evaluate the trigger's condition right away to react if that condition
 *      is true from the beginning.
 *
 * 4) Unregistration of a trigger
 *    - if the trigger's action is of type "notify",
 *      - remove the trigger from the notification_trigger_clients_ht,
 *    - remove trigger from channel_triggers_ht (if applicable),
 *    - remove trigger from triggers_ht
 *
 * 5) Reception of a channel monitor sample from the consumer daemon
 *    - evaluate the conditions associated with the triggers found in
 *      the channel_triggers_ht,
 *      - if a condition evaluates to "true" and the condition is of type
 *        "notify", query the notification_trigger_clients_ht and send
 *        a notification to the clients.
 *
 * 6) Connection of a client
 *    - add client socket to the client_socket_ht.
 *
 * 7) Disconnection of a client
 *    - remove client socket from the client_socket_ht,
 *    - traverse all conditions to which the client is subscribed and remove
 *      the client from the notification_trigger_clients_ht.
 *
 * 8) Subscription of a client to a condition's notifications
 *    - Add the condition to the client's list of subscribed conditions,
 *    - Look-up notification_trigger_clients_ht and add the client to
 *      list of clients.
 *    - Evaluate the condition for the client that subscribed if the trigger
 *      was already registered.
 *
 * 9) Unsubscription of a client to a condition's notifications
 *    - Remove the condition from the client's list of subscribed conditions,
 *    - Look-up notification_trigger_clients_ht and remove the client
 *      from the list of clients.
