NAME
----
lttng-load - Load LTTng tracing session configurations


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*lttng* ['linkgenoptions:(GENERAL OPTIONS)'] *load* [option:--force] [option:--input-path='PATH']
      [option:--override-url='URL'] [option:--override-name='NAME'] ['SESSION']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `lttng load` command loads the configurations of one or more
tracing sessions from files.

The `lttng load` command is used in conjunction with the
man:lttng-save(1) command to save and restore the complete
configurations of tracing sessions. This includes the enabled channels
and event rules, the context added to channels, the tracing activity,
and more.

Once one or more tracing session configurations are loaded, they appear
exactly as they were saved from the user's point of view.

The following directories are searched, non-recursively, in this order
for configuration files:

. `$LTTNG_HOME/.lttng/sessions` (`$LTTNG_HOME` defaults to `$HOME`)
. +{system_sessions_dir}+

The input path can be overridden with the option:--input-path option.
When this option is specified, the default directories are :not:
searched for configuration files. When it's not specified, _both_
default directories are searched for configuration files.

If the input path is a *directory*, then:

* If 'SESSION' is specified, the tracing session configuration named
  'SESSION' is searched for in all the files of this directory and
  loaded if found.
* If 'SESSION' is not specified, the option:--all option is implicit:
  all the tracing session configurations found in all the files in this
  directory are loaded.

If the input path is a *file*, then:

* If 'SESSION' is specified, the tracing session configuration named
  'SESSION' is searched for in this file and loaded if found.
* If 'SESSION' is not specified, the option:--all option is implicit:
  all the tracing session configurations found in this file are loaded.

Aspects of the loaded configurations can be overridden at load time.

option:--override-url::
    Provides the equivalent of the option:--set-url option
    of the (1)lttng-create command. The validity of the url override is
    dependant on the type of session(s) to be loaded. Refer to (1)lttng-create for
    the accepted URL format.

option:--override-name::
    Set the session name to NAME. This option is invalid in combination with
    the --all option.

By default, existing tracing sessions are not overwritten when loading:
the command fails. The option:--force option can be used to allow this.
