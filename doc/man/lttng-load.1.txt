NAME
----
lttng-load - Load LTTng tracing session configurations


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*lttng* ['linkgenoptions:(GENERAL OPTIONS)'] *load* [option:--force] [option:--input-path='PATH'] ['SESSION']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `lttng load` command loads the configurations of one or more
tracing sessions from files.

The `lttng load` command is used in conjunction with the
man:lttng-save(1) command to save and restore the complete
configurations of tracing sessions. This includes the enabled channels
and event rules, the context added to channels, the tracing activity,
and more.

Once one or more tracing session configurations are loaded, they appear
exactly as they were saved from the user's point of view.

The following directories are searched, non-recursively, in this order
for configuration files:

. `$LTTNG_HOME/.lttng/sessions` (`$LTTNG_HOME` defaults to `$HOME`)
. +{system_sessions_dir}+

The input path can be overridden with the option:--input-path option.
When this option is specified, the default directories are :not:
searched for configuration files. When it's not specified, _both_
default directories are searched for configuration files.

If the input path is a directory, then if 'SESSION' is specified, the
tracing session configuration named 'SESSION' is searched in all the
files of this directory and loaded if found. If 'SESSION' is not
specified, the option:--all option is implicit: all the tracing session
configurations found in all the files in this directory are loaded.

If the input path is a file, then if 'SESSION' is specified, the tracing
session configuration named 'SESSION' is searched in this file and
loaded if found. If 'SESSION' is not specified, the option:--all option
is implicit: all the tracing session configurations found in this file
are loaded.

By default, existing tracing sessions are not overwritten when loading;
the command fails. The option:--force option can be used to allow this.
