DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `lttng enable-event` command can create a new event rule, or enable
one or more existing and disabled ones.

An event rule created by `lttng enable-event` is a set of conditions
that must be satisfied in order for an actual event to be emitted by
an LTTng tracer when the execution of an application or the Linux kernel
reaches an event source (tracepoint, system call, dynamic probe).
Event sources can be listed with the man:lttng-list(1) command.

The man:lttng-disable-event(1) command can be used to disable
existing event rules.

Event rules are always assigned to a channel when they are created. If
the option:--channel option is omitted, a default channel named
`channel0` is used (and created automatically if it does not exist for
the specified domain in the selected tracing session).

If the option:--session option is omitted, the chosen channel is picked
from the current tracing session.

Events can be enabled while tracing is active
(use man:lttng-start(1) to make a tracing session active).


Event source types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Four types of event sources are available in the Linux kernel tracing
domain (option:--kernel option):

Tracepoint (option:--tracepoint option; default)::
    A Linux kernel tracepoint, that is, a static instrumentation point
    placed in the kernel source code. Standard tracepoints are designed
    and placed in the source code by developers and record useful
    payload fields.

Dynamic probe (option:--probe option)::
    A Linux kernel kprobe, that is, an instrumentation point placed
    dynamically in the compiled kernel code. Dynamic probe events do not
    record any payload field.

Function probe (option:--function option)::
    A Linux kernel kretprobe, that is, two instrumentation points placed
    dynamically where a function is entered and where it returns in the
    compiled kernel code. Function probe events do not record any
    payload field.

System call (option:--syscall option)::
    A Linux kernel system call. Two instrumentation points are
    statically placed where a system call function is entered and where
    it returns in the compiled kernel code. System call event sources
    record useful payload fields.

The application tracing domains (option:--userspace, option:--jul,
option:--log4j, or option:--python options) only support tracepoints.
In the cases of the JUL, Apache log4j, and Python domains, the event
names correspond to _logger_ names.


Understanding event rule conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When creating an event rule with `lttng enable-event`, conditions are
specified using options. The logical conjunction (logical AND) of all
those conditions must be true when an event source is reached by an
application or by the Linux kernel in order for an actual event
to be emitted by an LTTng tracer.

Any condition that is not explicitly specified on creation is considered
a _don't care_.

For example, consider the following commands:

[role="term"]
----
$ lttng enable-event --userspace hello:world
$ lttng enable-event --userspace hello:world --loglevel=TRACE_INFO
----

Here, two event rules are created. The first one has a single condition:
the tracepoint name must match `hello:world`. The second one has two
conditions:

* The tracepoint name must match `hello:world`, _and_
* The tracepoint's defined log level must be at least as severe as
  the `TRACE_INFO` level.

In this case, the second event rule is pointless because the first one
is more general: it does not care about the tracepoint's log level.
If an event source matching both event rules is reached by the
application's execution, only one event is emitted.

The available conditions for the Linux kernel domain are:

* Tracepoint/system call name ('EVENT' argument with
  option:--tracepoint or option:--syscall options) or
  dynamic probe/function name/address
  (option:--probe or option:--function option's argument) which must
  match event source's equivalent.
+
You can use `*` characters at any place in the tracepoint or system
call name as wildcards to match zero or more characters. To use a
literal `*` character, use :escwc:.

* Filter expression (option:--filter option) executed against the
  dynamic values of event fields at execution time that must evaluate
  to true. See the <<filter-syntax,Filter expression syntax>> section
  below for more information.

The available conditions for the application domains are:

* Tracepoint name ('EVENT' with option:--tracepoint option) which must
  match event source's equivalent.
+
You can use `*` characters at any place in the tracepoint name as
wildcards to match zero or more characters. To use a literal `*`
character, use :escwc:. When you create an event rule with a tracepoint
name containing a wildcard, you can exclude specific tracepoint names
from the match with the option:--exclude option.

* Filter expression (option:--filter option) executed against the
  dynamic values of event fields at execution time that must evaluate
  to true. See the <<filter-syntax,Filter expression syntax>> section
  below for more information.
* Event's log level that must be at least as severe as a given
  log level (option:--loglevel option) or match exactly a given log
  level (option:--loglevel-only option).

When using `lttng enable-event` with a set of conditions that does not
currently exist for the chosen tracing session, domain, and channel,
a new event rule is created. Otherwise, the existing event rule is
enabled if it is currently disabled
(see man:lttng-disable-event(1)).

The option:--all option can be used alongside the option:--tracepoint
or option:--syscall options. When this option is used, no 'EVENT'
argument must be specified. This option defines a single event rule
matching _all_ the possible events of a given tracing domain for the
chosen channel and tracing session. It is the equivalent of an 'EVENT'
argument named `*` (wildcard).


[[filter-syntax]]
Filter expression syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A filter expression can be specified with the option:--filter option
when creating a new event rule. If the filter expression evaluates to
true when executed against the dynamic values of an event's fields when
tracing, the filtering condition passes.

NOTE: Make sure to **single-quote** the filter expression when running
the command from a shell, as filter expressions typically include
characters having a special meaning for most shells.

The filter expression syntax is very similar to C language conditional
expressions (expressions that can be evaluated by an `if` statement).

The following logical operators are supported:

[width="40%",options="header"]
|=====================================
| Name                      | Syntax
| Logical negation (NOT)    | `!a`
| Logical conjunction (AND) | `a && b`
| Logical disjunction (OR)  | `a \|\| b`
|=====================================

The following comparison operators/relational operators are supported:

[width="40%",options="header"]
|====================================
| Name                     | Syntax
| Equal to                 | `a == b`
| Not equal to             | `a != b`
| Greater than             | `a > b`
| Less than                | `a < b`
| Greater than or equal to | `a >= b`
| Less than or equal to    | `a <= b`
|====================================

The arithmetic and bitwise operators are :not: supported.

The precedence table of the operators above is the same as the one of
the C language. Parentheses are supported to bypass this.

The dynamic value of an event field is read by using its name as a C
identifier.

The dynamic value of a statically-known context field is read by
prefixing its name with `$ctx.`. Statically-known context fields are
context fields added to channels without the `$app.` prefix using the
man:lttng-add-context(1) command. `$ctx.cpu_id` is also available as the
ID of the CPU which emits the event.

The dynamic value of an application-specific context field is read by
prefixing its name with `$app.` (follows the format used to add such a
context field with the man:lttng-add-context(1) command).

When a comparison includes a non existent event field, the whole filter
expression evaluates to false (the event is discarded).

C integer and floating point number constants are supported, as well as
literal strings between double quotes (`"`). You can use `*` characters
at any place in a literal string as wildcards to match zero or more
characters. To use a literal `*` character, use :escwc:.

LTTng-UST enumeration fields can be compared to integer values (fields
or constants).

NOTE: Although it is possible to filter the process ID of an event when
the `pid` context has been added to its channel using, for example,
`$ctx.pid == 2832`, it is recommended to use the PID tracker instead,
which is much more efficient (see man:lttng-track(1)).

Examples:

----------------------------
msg_id == 23 && size >= 2048
----------------------------

-------------------------------------------------
$ctx.procname == "lttng*" && (!flag || poel < 34)
-------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------
$app.my_provider:my_context == 17.34e9 || some_enum >= 14
---------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------
$ctx.cpu_id == 2 && filename != "*.log"
---------------------------------------


[[log-levels]]
Log levels
~~~~~~~~~~
Tracepoints and log statements in applications have an attached log
level. Application event rules can contain a _log level_ condition.

With the option:--loglevel option, the event source's log level must
be at least as severe as the option's argument. With the
option:--loglevel-only option, the event source's log level must match
the option's argument.
