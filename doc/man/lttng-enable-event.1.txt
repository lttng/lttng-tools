      (option:--all | 'NAME'[,'NAME']...) [option:--filter='EXPR']
      [option:--session='SESSION'] [option:--channel='CHANNEL']

Create or enable a recording event rule to match Linux kernel events
created from a dynamic instrumentation point:

      [option:--session='SESSION'] [option:--channel='CHANNEL']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `lttng enable-event` command does one of:

* Create one or more recording event rules.

* Enable one or more existing, disabled recording event rules.
+
See the <<enable,Enable a disabled recording event rule>> section
below.

An _instrumentation point_ is a point, within a piece of software,
which, when executed, creates an LTTng _event_.

LTTng offers various types of instrumentation; see the
<<inst-point-type-cond,Instrumentation point type condition>> section
below to learn about them.

An _event rule_ is a set of conditions to match a set of events. A
_recording event rule_ is a specific type of event rule of which the
associated action is to serialize and record the matched event.

When LTTng creates an event{nbsp}__E__, a recording event
rule{nbsp}__ER__ is said to __match__{nbsp}__E__ when{nbsp}__E__
satisfies *all* the conditions of{nbsp}__ER__. This concept is similar
to a regular expression which matches a set of strings.

When a recording event rule matches an event, LTTng _emits_ the event,
therefore attempting to serialize and record it to one of the
sub-buffers of its attached channel (see man:lttng-enable-channel(1) to
learn more about LTTng channels).

Without the option:--channel option, the `enable-event` command selects
the channel named `channel0`. When the `enable-event` command creates a
recording event rule, it automatically creates the `channel0` channel
(for the specified tracing domain in the selected tracing session) if it
doesn't exist.

When multiple matching recording event rules are attached to the same
channel, LTTng attempts to serialize and record the matched event
_once_. In the following example, the second recording event
rule is redundant when both are enabled:

[role="term"]
----
$ lttng enable-event --userspace hello:world
$ lttng enable-event --userspace hello:world --loglevel=TRACE_INFO
----

Without the option:--session option, the `enable-event` command selects
the current tracing session (see man:lttng-create(1) and
man:lttng-set-session(1) to learn more about the current tracing
session).

[NOTE]
====
The event creation and emission processes are documentation concepts to
help understand the journey from an instrumentation point to the
serialization and recording of an event.

The actual creation of an event can be costly because LTTng needs to
evalute the arguments of the instrumentation point.

In practice, LTTng implements various optimizations for the Linux kernel
and user space tracing domains (option:--kernel and option:--userspace
options) to avoid actually creating an event when the tracer knows,
thanks to properties which are independent from the event payload and
current context, that it would never emit such an event. Those
properties are:

* The status of the rule itself (enabled or disabled).
* The status of the channel (enabled or disabled; see
  man:lttng-enable-channel(1) and man:lttng-disable-channel(1)).
* The activity of the tracing session (started or stopped; see
  man:lttng-start(1) and man:lttng-stop(1)).
* The instrumentation point type (see the
  <<inst-point-type-cond,Instrumentation point type>> section below).
* The instrumentation point name (or event name)
  (see the <<event-name-cond,Event name condition>> section below).
* The instrumentation point log level (see the
  <<inst-point-log-level-cond,Instrumentation point log level condition>>
  section below).

In other words: if, for a given instrumentation point{nbsp}__IP__, the
LTTng tracer knows that it would never emit and record an event,
executing{nbsp}__IP__ represents a simple boolean variable check and,
for the kernel tracer, a few process attribute checks.
====

List the existing recording event rules of a given tracing session
and/or channel with the man:lttng-list(1) command.

Disable an existing, enabled recording event rule with the
man:lttng-disable-event(1) command.


Recording event rule overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For LTTng to emit and record an event{nbsp}__E__,{nbsp}__E__ must
satisfy *all* the conditions of a recording event rule{nbsp}__ER__, that
is:

Explicit conditions::
    You set the following conditions when you create or
    enable{nbsp}__ER__ with the `enable-event` command:
+
--
* The instrumentation point type from which LTTng creates{nbsp}__E__
  has a specific type.
+
See the <<inst-point-type-cond,Instrumentation point type condition>>
section below.

* A pattern matches the name of{nbsp}__E__ while another pattern
  doesn't.
+
See the <<event-name-cond,Event name condition>> section below.

* The log level of the instrumentation point from which LTTng
  creates{nbsp}__E__ is at least as severe as some value, or is exactly
  some value.
+
See the <<inst-point-log-level-cond,Instrumentation point log level condition>>
section below.

* The fields of the payload of{nbsp}__E__ and the current context fields
  satisfy a filter expression.
+
See the <<filter-cond,Event payload and context filter condition>>
section below.
--

Implicit conditions::
+
--
* _ER_ itself is enabled.
+
A recording event rule is enabled on creation.
+
Enable an existing, disabled recording event rule with the
`enable-event` command.

* The channel to which{nbsp}__ER__ is attached is enabled.
+
A channel is enabled on creation.
+
Enable an existing, disabled channel with the
man:lttng-enable-channel(1) command.

* The tracing session of{nbsp}__ER__ is active (started).
+
A tracing session is inactive (stopped) on creation.
+
Start an inactive tracing session with the man:lttng-start(1) command.

* The process for which LTTng creates{nbsp}__E__ to match is allowed to
  record events.
+
All processes are allowed to record events on tracing session
creation.
+
Use the man:lttng-track(1) and man:lttng-untrack(1) commands to select
which processes are allowed to record events based on specific process
attributes.
--

The dedicated command-line options of most conditions are optional: if
you don't specify the option, the associated condition is always
satisfied.


[[inst-point-type-cond]]
Instrumentation point type condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An event{nbsp}__E__ satisfies the instrumentation point type condition
of a recording event rule if the instrumentation point from which LTTng
creates{nbsp}__E__ is:

For the Linux kernel tracing domain (option:--kernel option)::
    With the option:--tracepoint option or without any other instrumentation point type option:::
        An LTTng kernel tracepoint, that is, a statically defined point
        in the source code of the kernel image or of a kernel module
        with LTTng kernel tracer macros.
+
As of LTTng{nbsp}{lttng_version}, this is the default instrumentation
point type of the Linux kernel tracing domain, but this may change in
the future.
+
List the available Linux kernel tracepoints with `lttng list --kernel`.
See man:lttng-list(1) to learn more.

    With the option:--syscall option:::
        The entry and exit of a Linux kernel system call.
+
List the available Linux kernel system call instrumentation points with
`lttng list --kernel --syscall`. See man:lttng-list(1) to learn more.

    With the option:--probe option:::
        A Linux kprobe, that is, a single probe dynamically placed in
        the compiled kernel code.
+
The argument of the option:--probe option is the location of the
kprobe to insert, either a symbol or a
memory address, while 'RECORDNAME' is the name of the record
of{nbsp}__E__ (see the <<er-name,Event record name>> section below).
+
The payload of a Linux kprobe event is empty.

    With the option:--userspace-probe option:::
        A Linux user space probe, that is, a single probe dynamically
        placed at the entry of a compiled user space application/library
        function through the kernel.
+
The argument of the option:--userspace-probe option is the location
of the user space probe to insert, one of:
+
--
* A path and symbol (ELF method).
* A path, provider name, and probe name (SystemTap User-level Statically
  Defined Tracing (USDT) method; a DTrace-style marker).
+
As of LTTng{nbsp}{lttng_version}, LTTng only supports USDT probes which
are :not: reference-counted.
--
+
'RECORDNAME' is the name of the record of{nbsp}__E__ (see the
<<er-name,Event record name>> section below).
+
The payload of a Linux user space probe event is empty.

    With the option:--function option:::
        A Linux kretprobe, that is, two probes dynamically placed at the
        entry and exit of a function in the compiled kernel code.
+
The argument of the option:--function option is the location of the
Linux kretprobe to insert, either a symbol or
a memory address, while 'RECORDNAME' is the name of the record
of{nbsp}__E__ (see the <<er-name,Event record name>> section below).
+
The payload of a Linux kretprobe event is empty.

For the user space tracing domain (option:--userspace option)::
    With or without the option:--tracepoint option:::
        An LTTng user space tracepoint, that is, a statically defined
        point in the source code of a C/$$C++$$ application/library with
        LTTng user space tracer macros.
+
As of LTTng{nbsp}{lttng_version}, this is the default and sole
instrumentation point type of the user space tracing domain, but this
may change in the future.
+
List the available user space tracepoints with `lttng list --userspace`.
See man:lttng-list(1) to learn more.

For the `java.util.logging` (option:--jul option), Apache log4j (option:--log4j option), and Python (option:--python option) tracing domains::
    With or without the option:--tracepoint option:::
        A logging statement.
+
As of LTTng{nbsp}{lttng_version}, this is the default and sole
instrumentation point type of the `java.util.logging`, Apache log4j, and
Python tracing domains, but this may change in the future.
+
List the available Java and Python loggers with `lttng list --jul`,
`lttng list --log4j`, and `lttng list --python`. See man:lttng-list(1)
to learn more.


[[event-name-cond]]
Event name condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An event{nbsp}__E__ satisfies the event name condition of a recording
event rule{nbsp}__ER__ if the two following statements are true:

* You specify the option:--all option or, depending on the
  instrumentation type condition (see the
  <<inst-point-type-cond,Instrumentation point type condition>> section
  above) of{nbsp}__ER__, 'NAME' matches:
+
--
LTTng tracepoint::
    The full name of the tracepoint from which LTTng creates{nbsp}__E__.
+
Note that the full name of a user space tracepoint is
__PROVIDER__++:++__NAME__, where __PROVIDER__ is the tracepoint provider
name and __NAME__ is the tracepoint name.

Logging statement::
    The name of the Java or Python logger from which LTTng
    creates{nbsp}__E__.

Linux system call::
    The name of the system call, without any `sys_` prefix, from which
    LTTng creates{nbsp}__E__.
--

* You don't specify the option:--exclude=__XNAME__[++,++__XNAME__]...
  option or, depending on the instrumentation type condition
  of{nbsp}__ER__, none of the 'XNAME' arguments matches the full name of
  the user space tracepoint from which LTTng creates{nbsp}__E__.
+
The option:--exclude option is only available with the option:--userspace
option.

This condition is only meaningful for the LTTng tracepoint, logging
statement, and Linux system call instrumentation point types: it's
always satisfied for the other types.

In all cases, 'NAME' and 'XNAME' are globbing patterns: the `*`
character means ``match anything''. To match a literal `*` character,
use :escwc:. To match a literal `,` character, use
:esccomma:.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to **single-quote** 'NAME' and 'XNAME' when they
contain the `*` character and when you run the `enable-event` command
from a shell.

With the LTTng tracepoint, logging statement, and Linux system call
instrumentation point types, the `enable-event` command creates or
enables one independent recording event rule per 'NAME' argument
(non-option, comma-separated). With the option:--all option, the
`enable-event` command creates or enables a single recording event rule.


[[inst-point-log-level-cond]]
Instrumentation point log level condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An event{nbsp}__E__ satisfies the instrumentation point log level
condition of a recording event rule if either:

* The option:--loglevel and option:--loglevel-only options are
  missing.

* The log level of the LTTng user space tracepoint or logging statement
  which creates{nbsp}__E__ is:
      With the option:--loglevel='LOGLEVEL' option::
          At least as severe as 'LOGLEVEL'.

      With the option:--loglevel-only='LOGLEVEL' option::
          Exactly 'LOGLEVEL'.

This condition is only meaningful for the LTTng user space tracepoint
and logging statement instrumentation point types: it's always satisfied
for other types.

The available values of 'LOGLEVEL' are, depending on the tracing domain,
from the most to the least severe:

User space (option:--userspace option)::
    Shortcuts such as `system` are allowed.
+
* `TRACE_EMERG` (0)
* `TRACE_ALERT` (1)
* `TRACE_CRIT` (2)
* `TRACE_ERR` (3)
* `TRACE_WARNING` (4)
* `TRACE_NOTICE` (5)
* `TRACE_INFO` (6)
* `TRACE_DEBUG_SYSTEM` (7)
* `TRACE_DEBUG_PROGRAM` (8)
* `TRACE_DEBUG_PROCESS` (9)
* `TRACE_DEBUG_MODULE` (10)
* `TRACE_DEBUG_UNIT` (11)
* `TRACE_DEBUG_FUNCTION` (12)
* `TRACE_DEBUG_LINE` (13)
* `TRACE_DEBUG` (14)

`java.util.logging` (option:--jul option)::
    Shortcuts such as `severe` are allowed.
+
* `JUL_OFF` (`INT32_MAX`)
* `JUL_SEVERE` (1000)
* `JUL_WARNING` (900)
* `JUL_INFO` (800)
* `JUL_CONFIG` (700)
* `JUL_FINE` (500)
* `JUL_FINER` (400)
* `JUL_FINEST` (300)
* `JUL_ALL` (`INT32_MIN`)

Apache log4j (option:--log4j option)::
    Shortcuts such as `severe` are allowed.
+
* `LOG4J_OFF` (`INT32_MAX`)
* `LOG4J_FATAL` (50000)
* `LOG4J_ERROR` (40000)
* `LOG4J_WARN` (30000)
* `LOG4J_INFO` (20000)
* `LOG4J_DEBUG` (10000)
* `LOG4J_TRACE` (5000)
* `LOG4J_ALL` (`INT32_MIN`)

Python (option:--python option)::
    Shortcuts such as `critical` are allowed.
+
* `PYTHON_CRITICAL` (50)
* `PYTHON_ERROR` (40)
* `PYTHON_WARNING` (30)
* `PYTHON_INFO` (20)
* `PYTHON_DEBUG` (10)
* `PYTHON_NOTSET` (0)


[[filter-cond]]
Event payload and context filter condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An event{nbsp}__E__ satisfies the event payload and context filter
condition of a recording event rule if the option:--filter='EXPR'
option is missing or if 'EXPR' is _true_.

'EXPR' can contain references to the payload fields of{nbsp}__E__ and
to the current context fields.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to **single-quote** 'EXPR' when you run the
`enable-event` command from a shell, as filter expressions typically
include characters having a special meaning for most shells.

The expected syntax of 'EXPR' is similar to the syntax of a
C{nbsp}language conditional expression (an expression which an `if`
statement can evaluate), but there are a few differences:

* A _NAME_ expression identifies an event payload field named
  _NAME_ (a C{nbsp}identifier).
+
Use the C{nbsp}language dot and square bracket notations to access
nested structure and array/sequence fields. You can only use a constant,
positive integer number within square brackets. If the index is out of
bounds, 'EXPR' is _false_.
+
The value of an enumeration field is an integer.
+
When a field expression doesn't exist, 'EXPR' is _false_.
+
Examples: `my_field`, `target_cpu`, `seq[7]`, `msg.user[1].data[2][17]`.

* A ++$ctx.++__TYPE__ expression identifies the statically-known context
  field having the type _TYPE_ (a C{nbsp}identifier).
+
List the available statically-known context field names with the
man:lttng-add-context(1) command.
+
When a field expression doesn't exist, 'EXPR' is _false_.
+
Examples: `$ctx.prio`, `$ctx.preemptible`,
`$ctx.perf:cpu:stalled-cycles-frontend`.

* A ++$app.++__PROVIDER__++:++__TYPE__ expression identifies the
  application-specific context field having the type _TYPE_ (a
  C{nbsp}identifier) from the provider _PROVIDER_ (a C{nbsp}identifier).
+
When a field expression doesn't exist, 'EXPR' is _false_.
+
Example: `$app.server:cur_user`.

* Compare strings, either string fields or string literals
  (double-quoted), with the `==` and `!=` operators.
+
When comparing to a string literal, the `*` character means ``match
anything''. To match a literal `*` character, use :escwc:.
+
Examples: `my_field == "user34"`, `my_field == my_other_field`,
`my_field == "192.168.*"`.

* The precedence table of the operators which are supported in 'EXPR'
  is as follows. In this table, the highest precedence is{nbsp}1:
+
[options="header"]
|===
|Precedence |Operator |Description |Associativity
|1 |`-` |Unary minus |Right-to-left
|1 |`+` |Unary plus |Right-to-left
|1 |`!` |Logical NOT |Right-to-left
|1 |`~` |Bitwise NOT |Right-to-left
|2 |`<<` |Bitwise left shift |Left-to-right
|2 |`>>` |Bitwise right shift |Left-to-right
|3 |`&` |Bitwise AND |Left-to-right
|4 |`^` |Bitwise XOR |Left-to-right
|5 |`\|` |Bitwise OR |Left-to-right
|6 |`<` |Less than |Left-to-right
|6 |`<=` |Less than or equal to |Left-to-right
|6 |`>` |Greater than |Left-to-right
|6 |`>=` |Greater than or equal to |Left-to-right
|7 |`==` |Equal to |Left-to-right
|7 |`!=` |Not equal to |Left-to-right
|8 |`&&` |Logical AND |Left-to-right
|9 |`\|\|` |Logical OR |Left-to-right
|===
+
Parentheses are supported to bypass the default order.
+
IMPORTANT: Unlike the C{nbsp}language, the bitwise AND and OR operators
(`&` and `|`) in 'EXPR' take precedence over relational operators (`<`,
`<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, and `!=`). This means the expression `2 & 2 == 2`
is _true_ while the equivalent C{nbsp}expression is _false_.
+
The arithmetic operators are :not: supported.
+
LTTng first casts all integer constants and fields to signed 64-bit
integers. The representation of negative integers is two's complement.
This means that, for example, the signed 8-bit integer field 0xff (-1)
becomes 0xffffffffffffffff (still -1) once casted.
+
Before a bitwise operator is applied, LTTng casts all its operands to
unsigned 64-bit integers, and then casts the result back to a signed
64-bit integer. For the bitwise NOT operator, it's the equivalent of
this C{nbsp}expression:
+
[source,c]
----
(int64_t) ~((uint64_t) val)
----
+
For the binary bitwise operators, it's the equivalent of those
C{nbsp}expressions:
+
[source,c]
----
(int64_t) ((uint64_t) lhs >> (uint64_t) rhs)
(int64_t) ((uint64_t) lhs << (uint64_t) rhs)
(int64_t) ((uint64_t) lhs & (uint64_t) rhs)
(int64_t) ((uint64_t) lhs ^ (uint64_t) rhs)
(int64_t) ((uint64_t) lhs | (uint64_t) rhs)
----
+
If the right-hand side of a bitwise shift operator (`<<` and `>>`) is
not in the [0,{nbsp}63] range, then 'EXPR' is _false_.

[NOTE]
====
Use the man:lttng-track(1) and man:lttng-untrack(1) commands to allow or
disallow processes to record LTTng events based on their attributes
instead of using equivalent statically-known context fields in 'EXPR'
like `$ctx.pid`.

The former method is much more efficient.
====

'EXPR' examples:

----------------------------
msg_id == 23 && size >= 2048
----------------------------

-------------------------------------------------
$ctx.procname == "lttng*" && (!flag || poel < 34)
-------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------
$app.my_provider:my_context == 17.34e9 || some_enum >= 14
---------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------
$ctx.cpu_id == 2 && filename != "*.log"
---------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
eax_reg & 0xff7 == 0x240 && x[4] >> 12 <= 0x1234
------------------------------------------------


[[er-name]]
Event record name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When LTTng records an event{nbsp}__E__, the resulting event record has a
name which depends on the instrumentation point type condition (see the
<<inst-point-type-cond,Instrumentation point type condition>> section)
of the recording event rule which matched{nbsp}__E__:

LTTng tracepoint (option:--kernel/option:--userspace and option:--tracepoint options)::
    Full name of the tracepoint from which LTTng creates{nbsp}__E__.
+
Note that the full name of a user space tracepoint is
__PROVIDER__++:++__NAME__, where __PROVIDER__ is the tracepoint provider
name and __NAME__ is the tracepoint name.

`java.util.logging` logging statement (option:--jul and option:--tracepoint options)::
    `lttng_jul:event`
+
Such an event record has a string field `logger_name` which contains the
name of the `java.util.logging` logger from which LTTng
creates{nbsp}__E__.

Apache log4j logging statement (option:--log4j and option:--tracepoint options)::
    `lttng_log4j:event`
+
Such an event record has a string field `logger_name` which contains the
name of the Apache log4j logger from which LTTng creates{nbsp}__E__.

Python logging statement (option:--python and option:--tracepoint options)::
    `lttng_python:event`
+
Such an event record has a string field `logger_name` which contains the
name of the Python logger from which LTTng creates{nbsp}__E__.

Linux system call (option:--kernel and option:--syscall options)::
    Entry:::
        ++syscall_entry_++__NAME__, where _NAME_ is the name of the
        system call from which LTTng creates{nbsp}__E__, without any
        `sys_` prefix.

    Exit:::
        ++syscall_exit_++__NAME__, where _NAME_ is the name of the
        system call from which LTTng creates{nbsp}__E__, without any
        `sys_` prefix.

Linux kprobe (option:--kernel and option:--probe options)::
Linux user space probe (option:--kernel and option:--userspace-probe options)::
    'RECORDNAME' (first non-option argument).

Linux kretprobe (option:--kernel and option:--function options)::
    Entry:::
        __RECORDNAME__++_entry++

    Exit:::
        __RECORDNAME__++_exit++


[[enable]]
Enable a disabled recording event rule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The `enable-event` command can enable an existing, disabled recording
event rule, as listed in the output of the man:lttng-list(1) command.

You may enable a disabled recording event rule regardless of the
activity (started or stopped) of its tracing session (see
man:lttng-start(1) and man:lttng-stop(1)).

To enable a disabled recording event rule, run the `enable-event`
command with the exact same options and arguments that you used to
create it. In particular, with the option:--filter='EXPR' option, 'EXPR'
must be the exact same string as the one you used on creation.

+
You must specify the event record name with 'RECORDNAME'. See the
<<er-name,Event record name>> section above to learn more.

option:--probe='LOC'::
    Only match Linux kprobe events.
+
Only available with the option:--kernel option.
+
'LOC' is one of:
+
--
* An address (`0x` hexadecimal prefix supported).
* A symbol name.
* A symbol name and an offset (__SYMBOL__++pass:[+]++__OFFSET__ format).
--
+
You must specify the event record name with 'RECORDNAME'. See the
<<er-name,Event record name>> section above to learn more.

option:--userspace-probe='LOC'::
    Only match Linux user space probe events.
+
Only available with the option:--kernel option.
+
'LOC' is one of:
+
--
\[++elf:++]__PATH__++:++__SYMBOL__::
    Probe an available symbol within a user space application or
    library.
+
--
'PATH'::
    Application or library path.
+
One of:
+
* An absolute path.
* A relative path.
* The name of an application as found in the directories listed in the
  `PATH` environment variable.

'SYMBOL'::
    Symbol name of the function of which to instrument the entry.
+
'SYMBOL' can be any defined code symbol in the output of the man:nm(1)
command, including with its nloption:--dynamic option, which lists
dynamic symbols.
--
+
As of LTTng{nbsp}{lttng_version}, not specifying `elf:` is equivalent to
specifying it, but this default may change in the future.
+
Examples:
+
* `--userspace-probe=/usr/lib/libc.so.6:malloc`
* `--userspace-probe=./myapp:createUser`
* `--userspace-probe=elf:httpd:ap_run_open_htaccess`

++sdt:++__PATH__++:++__PROVIDER__++:++__NAME__::
    Use a SystemTap User-level Statically Defined Tracing (USDT) probe
    within a user space application or library.
+
--
'PATH'::
    Application or library path.
+
This can be:
+
* An absolute path.
* A relative path.
* The name of an application as found in the directories listed in the
  `PATH` environment variable.

'PROVIDER'::
'NAME'::
    USDT provider and probe names.
+
For example, with the following USDT probe:
+
[source,c]
----
DTRACE_PROBE2("server", "accept_request",
              request_id, ip_addr);
----
+
The provider/probe name pair is `server:accept_request`.
--
+
Example: `--userspace-probe=sdt:./build/server:server:accept_request`
--
+
You must specify the event record name with 'RECORDNAME'. See the
<<er-name,Event record name>> section above to learn more.

option:--syscall::
    Only match Linux system call events.
+
Only available with the option:--kernel option.

option:--tracepoint::
    Only match:
+
With the option:--kernel or option:--userspace option:::
    LTTng tracepoint events.
With the option:--jul, option:--log4j, or option:--python option:::
    Logging events.

With the option:--kernel, not specifying any of the instrumentation
point type options is equivalent to specifying the option:--tracepoint
option, but this default may change in the future.

With the option:--userspace, option:--jul, option:--log4j, and
option:--python options, not specifying the option:--tracepoint option
is equivalent to specifying it, but this default may change in the
future.


Event name condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See the <<event-name-cond,Event name condition>> section above.

option:-a, option:--all::
    Equivalent to a single 'NAME' argument (LTTng tracepoint or logger
    name) set to `*` (match anything).
+
You may :not: use this option with a 'NAME' argument.

option:-x 'XNAME'[,'XNAME']..., option:--exclude='XNAME'[,'XNAME']...::
    Only match events of which none of the 'XNAME' arguments
    matches the full name of the LTTng user space tracepoint.
+
Only available with the option:--userspace option.
+
'XNAME' is a globbing pattern: the `*` character means ``match
anything''. To match a literal `*` character, use :escwc:. To match
a literal `,` character, use :esccomma:.


Instrumentation point log level condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See the <<inst-point-log-level-cond,Instrumentation point log level
condition>> section above.

At most one of:

option:--loglevel='LOGLEVEL'::
    Only match events of which the log level of the LTTng tracepoint or
    logging statement is at least as severe as 'LOGLEVEL'.

option:--loglevel-only='LOGLEVEL'::
    Only match events of which the log level of the LTTng tracepoint or
    logging statement is exactly 'LOGLEVEL'.

The instrumentation point log level options above are :not: available
with the option:--kernel option.


Event payload and context filter condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See the <<filter-cond,Event payload and context filter condition>>
section above.

option:-f 'EXPR', option:--filter='EXPR'::
    Only match events of which 'EXPR', which can contain references to
    event payload and current context fields, is _true_.
