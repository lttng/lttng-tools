lttng-stop(1)
=============


NAME
----
lttng-stop - Stop LTTng tracers


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*lttng stop* ['GENERAL OPTIONS'] [option:--no-wait] ['SESSION']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `lttng stop` command stops the various LTTng tracers for a given
active tracing session.

Stoping the LTTng tracers has the effect that all enabled event rules
within enabled channels cannot make event sources _emit_ trace events
anymore.

A tracing session with no running tracers is said to be _inactive_.
Inactive tracing sessions can be set active using the
linklttng:lttng-start(1) command.

If 'SESSION' is omitted, the LTTng tracers are stopped for the current
tracing session (see linklttng:lttng-create(1) for more information
about the current tracing session). Otherwise, they are stopped for the
existing tracing session named 'SESSION'. `lttng list`
outputs all the existing tracing sessions (see linklttng:lttng-list(1)).

By default, the `lttng stop` command waits for trace data to become
available before returning to the prompt. This wait time can be avoided
using the option:--no-wait option. In this case, there is no way to
know when the trace data becomes available, as the command returns
immediately.
