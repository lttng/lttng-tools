NAME
----
lttng-stop - Stop an LTTng recording session


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*lttng* ['linkgenoptions:(GENERAL OPTIONS)'] *stop* [option:--no-wait] [option:--all | option:--glob 'SESSION' | 'SESSION']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `lttng stop` command stops a recording session, that is, it
deactivates the LTTng tracers for:

With the 'SESSION' argument::
    The recording session named 'SESSION'.

Without the 'SESSION' argument::
    The current recording session (see man:lttng-concepts(7) to learn more
    about the current recording session).

See man:lttng-concepts(7) to learn more about recording sessions.

The selected recording session must be active (started; see
man:lttng-start(1)). A recording session is inactive on creation (see
man:lttng-create(1)).

A `stop-session` trigger action can also stop a recording session (see
man:lttng-add-trigger(1)).

Start an inactive recording session with the man:lttng-start(1) command.

By default, the `stop` command ensures that the trace data of the
selected recording session is valid before it exits. Make the command
exit immediately with the option:--no-wait option. In this case,
however, the traces(s) might not be valid when the command exits, and
there's no way to know when it/they becomes valid.

If LTTng archived the current trace chunk (see man:lttng-rotate(1) and
man:lttng-enable-rotation(1)) of the selected recording session at least
once during its lifetime, the `stop` command renames the current trace
chunk subdirectory and prints the renamed path. Although it's safe to
read the content of this renamed subdirectory while the recording
session remains inactive, it's :not: a trace chunk archive: you need to
destroy the recording session with man:lttng-destroy(1) or perform a
rotation with man:lttng-rotate(1) to archive it.

See the ``<<examples,EXAMPLES>>'' section below for usage examples.
