lttng-stop(1)
=============


NAME
----
lttng-stop - Stop LTTng tracers


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*lttng* ['linkgenoptions:(GENERAL OPTIONS)'] *stop* [option:--no-wait] ['SESSION']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `lttng stop` command stops the various LTTng tracers for a given
active tracing session.

Stopping the LTTng tracers has the effect that all enabled event rules
within enabled channels cannot make event sources _emit_ trace events
anymore.

A tracing session with no running tracers is said to be _inactive_.
Inactive tracing sessions can be set active using the
man:lttng-start(1) command.

If 'SESSION' is omitted, the LTTng tracers are stopped for the current
tracing session (see man:lttng-create(1) for more information
about the current tracing session). Otherwise, they are stopped for the
existing tracing session named 'SESSION'. `lttng list`
outputs all the existing tracing sessions (see man:lttng-list(1)).

By default, the `lttng stop` command ensures that the tracing session's
trace data is valid before returning to the prompt. With the
option:--no-wait option, the command finishes immediately, hence a local
trace might not be valid when the command is done. In this case, there
is no way to know when the trace becomes valid.

If at least one rotation occurred during the chosen tracing session's
lifetime (see man:lttng-rotate(1) and man:lttng-enable-rotation(1)), the
`lttng stop` command renames the current trace chunk subdirectory and
prints the renamed path. Although it is safe to read the content of this
renamed subdirectory while the tracing session remains inactive (until
the next man:lttng-start(1)), it is :not: a trace chunk archive: you
need to destroy the tracing session with man:lttng-destroy(1) or make
a rotation with man:lttng-rotate(1) to archive it.
