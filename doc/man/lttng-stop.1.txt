lttng-stop(1)
=============


NAME
----
lttng-stop - Stop LTTng tracers


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*lttng* ['linkgenoptions:(GENERAL OPTIONS)'] *stop* [option:--no-wait] ['SESSION']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `lttng stop` command stops the various LTTng tracers for a given
active tracing session.

Stopping the LTTng tracers has the effect that all enabled event rules
within enabled channels cannot make event sources _emit_ trace events
anymore.

A tracing session with no running tracers is said to be _inactive_.
Inactive tracing sessions can be set active using the
man:lttng-start(1) command.

If 'SESSION' is omitted, the LTTng tracers are stopped for the current
tracing session (see man:lttng-create(1) for more information
about the current tracing session). Otherwise, they are stopped for the
existing tracing session named 'SESSION'. `lttng list`
outputs all the existing tracing sessions (see man:lttng-list(1)).

By default, the `lttng stop` command ensures that the tracing session's
trace data is valid before returning to the prompt. With the
option:--no-wait option, the command finishes immediately, hence a local
trace might not be valid when the command is done. In this case, there
is no way to know when the trace becomes valid.
