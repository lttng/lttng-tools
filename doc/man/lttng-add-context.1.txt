NAME
----
lttng-add-context - Add context fields to an LTTng channel


SYNOPSIS
--------
Add context fields to a channel:

[verse]
*lttng* ['linkgenoptions:(GENERAL OPTIONS)'] *add-context*
      (option:--kernel | option:--userspace | option:--jul | option:--log4j)
      [option:--session='SESSION'] [option:--channel='CHANNEL']
      option:--type='TYPE' [option:--type='TYPE']...

List the available context fields:

[verse]
*lttng* ['linkgenoptions:(GENERAL OPTIONS)'] *add-context* option:--list


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `lttng add-context` command adds one or more context fields to a
channel.

Channels are created with the man:lttng-enable-channel(1) command.

When context fields are added to a channel, all the events emitted
within this channel contain the dynamic values of those context fields.

If the option:--session option is omitted, the current tracing session
is used. If the option:--channel option is omitted, the context fields
are added to all the selected tracing session's channels.

Many context fields can be added to a channel at once by repeating the
option:--type option.

perf counters are available as per-CPU (`perf:cpu:` prefix) as well as
per-thread (`perf:thread:` prefix) counters. Currently, per-CPU counters
can only be used in the Linux kernel tracing domain, while per-thread
counters can only be used in the user space tracing domain.

It is also possible to enable PMU counters by raw ID using the
`perf:cpu:raw:r<N>:<name>` or `perf:thread:raw:r<N>:<name>` format for
the kernel and user-space respectively. `<N>` is a hexadecimal event
descriptor which is the same format as used by perf-record(1): a
concatenation of the `Umask value` and `Event number` provided by the
processor's manufacturer. The possible values for this field are
processor-specific. The `<name>` field is used to associate a clearer
name to the counter.

Application-specific context fields can be added to a channel using the
following syntax:

[verse]
$app.'PROVIDER':__TYPE__

with:

'PROVIDER'::
    Provider name.

'TYPE'::
    Context type name.

NOTE: Make sure to **single-quote** the type when running the command
from a shell, as `$` is a special character for variable substitution in
most shells.

Use the option:--list option without other arguments to list the
available context field names.

Domain
~~~~~~
One of:

option:-j, option:--jul::
    Add context to channel in the `java.util.logging` (JUL) domain.

option:-k, option:--kernel::
    Add context to channel in the Linux kernel domain.

option:-l, option:--log4j::
    Add context to channel in the Apache log4j domain.

option:-u, option:--userspace::
    Add context to channel in the user space domain.


Target
~~~~~~
option:-c, option:--channel='CHANNEL'::
    Add context fields to a channel named 'CHANNEL' instead of adding
    them to all the channels.

option:-s, option:--session='SESSION'::
    Add context fields to a channel in the tracing session named 'SESSION'
    instead of the current tracing session.


Context
~~~~~~~
option:--list::
    List the available context fields. Use this option alone.

option:-t, option:--type='TYPE'::
    Add context field named 'TYPE'. This option can be repeated as
    many times as needed on the command-line.
