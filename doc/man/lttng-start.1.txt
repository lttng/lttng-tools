lttng-start(1)
==============


NAME
----
lttng-start - Start LTTng tracers


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*lttng start* ['GENERAL OPTIONS'] ['SESSION']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `lttng start` command starts the various LTTng tracers for a
given inactive tracing session.

Starting the LTTng tracers has the effect that all enabled event rules
within enabled channels can make their target event sources _emit_ trace
events. Whether they are recorded to the local file system, sent over
the network, or not recorded at all depends on the specific
configuration of the tracing session in which tracing is started. See
linklttng:lttng-create(1) for different session modes.

A tracing session with running tracers is said to be _active_. Active
tracing sessions can return to the inactive state using the
linklttng:lttng-stop(1) command.

If 'SESSION' is omitted, the LTTng tracers are started for the current
tracing session (see linklttng:lttng-create(1) for more information
about the current tracing session). Otherwise, they are started for the
existing tracing session named 'SESSION'. `lttng list`
outputs all the existing tracing sessions (see linklttng:lttng-list(1)).
