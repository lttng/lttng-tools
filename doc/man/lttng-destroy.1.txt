NAME
----
lttng-destroy - Destroy an LTTng tracing session


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*lttng* ['linkgenoptions:(GENERAL OPTIONS)'] *destroy* [option:--no-wait] [option:--all | 'SESSION']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `lttng destroy` command destroys one or more tracing sessions.

If no options are specified, the current tracing session is destroyed
(see man:lttng-create(1) for more information about the current
tracing session).

If 'SESSION' is specified, the existing tracing session named 'SESSION'
is destroyed. `lttng list` outputs all the existing tracing sessions
(see man:lttng-list(1)).

If the option:--all option is used, *all* the tracing sessions, as listed
in the output of `lttng list`, are destroyed.

Destroying a tracing session stops any tracing running within the
latter. By default, the implicit man:lttng-stop(1) command invoked by
the `lttng destroy` command ensures that the tracing session's trace
data is valid before returning. With the option:--no-wait option, the
man:lttng-stop(1) command finishes immediately, hence a local trace
might not be valid when the command is done. In this case, there is no
way to know when the trace becomes valid.

Destroying a tracing session does not destroy the recorded trace data,
if any; it frees resources acquired by the session daemon and tracer
side, making sure to flush all trace data.
