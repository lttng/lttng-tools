NAME
----
lttng-destroy - Destroy an LTTng tracing session


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*lttng* ['linkgenoptions:(GENERAL OPTIONS)'] *destroy* [option:--no-wait] [option:--all | 'SESSION']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `lttng destroy` command destroys one or more tracing sessions.

If no options are specified, the current tracing session is destroyed
(see man:lttng-create(1) for more information about the current
tracing session).

If 'SESSION' is specified, the existing tracing session named 'SESSION'
is destroyed. `lttng list` outputs all the existing tracing sessions
(see man:lttng-list(1)).

If the option:--all option is used, *all* the tracing sessions, as listed
in the output of `lttng list`, are destroyed.

Destroying a tracing session stops any tracing running within the
latter. By default, the implicit man:lttng-stop(1) command invoked by
the `lttng destroy` command ensures that the tracing session's trace
data is valid before returning. With the option:--no-wait option, the
man:lttng-stop(1) command finishes immediately, hence a local trace
might not be valid when the command is done. In this case, there is no
way to know when the trace becomes valid.

Destroying a tracing session does not destroy the recorded trace data,
if any; it frees resources acquired by the session daemon and tracer
side, making sure to flush all trace data.

If at least one rotation occurred during the chosen tracing session's
lifetime (see man:lttng-rotate(1) and man:lttng-enable-rotation(1)), and
without the option:--no-wait option, all the tracing session's output
directory's subdirectories are considered trace chunk archives once the
command returns: it is safe to read them, modify them, move them, or
remove them.
