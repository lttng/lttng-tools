NAME
----
lttng-destroy - Destroy LTTng tracing sessions


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*lttng* ['linkgenoptions:(GENERAL OPTIONS)'] *destroy* [option:--no-wait] [option:--all | 'SESSION']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `lttng destroy` command destroys one or more tracing sessions
previously created with the man:lttng-create(1) command.

``Destroying'' a tracing session means freeing the resources acquired by
the LTTng daemons and tracers for it, also making sure to flush all the
recorded trace data to either the local file system or the connected
LTTng relay daemon (see man:lttng-relayd(8)), depending on the tracing
session mode.

Use the `destroy` command to destroy:

With the 'SESSION' argument::
    The tracing session named 'SESSION'.

With the option:--all option::
    *All* the tracing sessions of your Unix user,
    as listed in the output of `lttng list` (see man:lttng-list(1)).

Otherwise::
    The current tracing session (see man:lttng-create(1) and
    man:lttng-set-session(1) to learn more about the current tracing
    session).
+
In that case, the current tracing session becomes nonexistent.

The `destroy` command stops any tracing activity within the selected
tracing session(s). By default, the command runs the implicit
man:lttng-stop(1) command to ensure that the trace data of the tracing
session(s) is valid before it exits. Make the command exit immediately
with the option:--no-wait option. In this case, however, the traces(s)
might not be valid when the command exits, and there's no way to know
when it/they becomes valid.

If, for a tracing session{nbsp}__TS__ to destroy with the `destroy`
command, the following statements are true:

* You don't use the option:--no-wait option.

* LTTng archived the current trace chunk (see man:lttng-rotate(1) and
  man:lttng-enable-rotation(1)) of{nbsp}__TS__ at least once during its
  lifetime.

Then all the subdirectories of the output directory of{nbsp}__TS__
(local or remote) are considered trace chunk archives once the `destroy`
command exits. In other words, it's safe to read them, modify them, move
them, or remove then.
