WHAT'S NEW?
━━━━━━━━━━━
New features and changes in LTTng 2.14:

General:
    • User space channels now have a _buffer allocation policy_ which
      specifies whether LTTng tracers allocate ring buffers per CPU
      (what you've always known) or per channel.

      The buffering scheme term now refers to the ownership model
      (system, user, or process) and the allocation policy together.

      The new per-channel allocation policy means each user/process
      (depending on the buffer ownership model), instead of each CPU of
      each user/process, gets its own ring buffer.

    • User space tracing now supports the Apache Log4j 2 tracing domain
      in addition to the existing support for Apache log4j 1.2.

    • LTTng 2.14 brings _experimental_ support of CTF 2 [1] for both the
      user space and kernel tracers.

      CTF 2 output isn't enabled by default and is intended solely for
      preview and feedback purposes: having an experimental support will
      allow users to test and evaluate CTF 2 until we make it the
      default output format.

Tracing control:
    • The new `--buffer-allocation` option of the
      lttng-enable-channel(1) command can set the buffer allocation
      policy of the channel to create.

      The default `per-cpu` value is what you've always known while the
      new `per-channel` value is available for user space channels.

    • The new `--buffer-ownership` option of the `enable-channel`
      command of the `lttng` CLI tool replaces the `--buffers-global`,
      `--buffers-uid`, and `--buffers-pid` options (now deprecated).

    • The `enable-channel` command of the `lttng` CLI tool, when
      creating a user space channel with the usual per-CPU buffer
      allocation policy, automatically adds a `cpu_id` context field
      which, as of LTTng 2.14, you cannot remove. This has always been
      the case and remains true, but `cpu_id` is now an offically
      supported context field.

      Knowing this, with the new per-channel buffer allocation policy,
      the `enable-channel` command doesn't add the `cpu_id` context
      field: add it afterwards with the lttng-add-context(1) command if
      needed, for example:

          $ lttng add-context -u --channel=my-channel --type=cpu_id

    • Everywhere the Apache log4j 1.2 `--log4j` option or
      `log4j:logging` option value is available with the `lttng` CLI
      tool, you may now use resp. `--log4j2` and `log4j2:logging` to
      target the new Apache Log4j 2 [2] tracing domain.

    • The `liblttng-ctl` C API is updated to support the new features:

      ‣ Set and get the buffer allocation policy of a channel with
        `lttng_channel_set_allocation_policy()`
        and `lttng_channel_get_allocation_policy()`.

      ‣ Add the `cpu_id` context field to a channel with the
        `LTTNG_EVENT_CONTEXT_CPU_ID` enumerator when
        calling `lttng_add_context()`.

      ‣ Apache Log4j 2 functions and enumerators are available
        everywhere there are Apache Log4j 2 equivalents:

        ⁃ `LTTNG_DOMAIN_LOG4J2`
        ⁃ `LTTNG_EVENT_RULE_TYPE_LOG4J2_LOGGING`
        ⁃ `enum lttng_loglevel_log4j2`
        ⁃ `lttng_event_rule_log4j2_logging_create()`
        ⁃ `lttng_event_rule_log4j2_logging_get_filter()`
        ⁃ `lttng_event_rule_log4j2_logging_get_log_level_rule()`
        ⁃ `lttng_event_rule_log4j2_logging_get_name_pattern()`
        ⁃ `lttng_event_rule_log4j2_logging_set_filter()`
        ⁃ `lttng_event_rule_log4j2_logging_set_log_level_rule()`
        ⁃ `lttng_event_rule_log4j2_logging_set_name_pattern()`

      ‣ Get the status of the Linux kernel tracer
        with `lttng_get_kernel_tracer_status()`.

      ‣ Get the shared memory directory path of a recording session
        with `lttng_get_session_shm_path_override()`.

    • Set the `LTTNG_EXPERIMENTAL_FORCE_CTF_2` environment variable to
      `1` when starting `lttng-sessiond` to enable the experimental
      CTF 2 [1] output format.

      With this setting, all the recording sessions which the session
      daemon manages produce CTF 2 traces. As of LTTng 2.14, this is not
      a per-session configuration.

      The produced CTF 2 traces are expected to be semantically
      equivalent to what the tracers would have procuced without
      `LTTNG_EXPERIMENTAL_FORCE_CTF_2` set to `1` (CTF 1.8).

      └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

    • The `--all` option of the lttng-start(1) and lttng-stop(1)
      commands is now available to start/stop _all_ the
      recording sessions.

    • The `--glob` option of the `start`, and `stop`, and
      lttng-destroy(1) commands is now available to start/stop/destroy
      recording sessions of which some globbing pattern matches
      the name.

    • New lttng-relayd(8) options are available to help control
      its process:

      `--dynamic-port-allocation`::
          Let the operating system assign the control, data, and live
          ports if their respective option is missing (`--control-port`,
          `--data-port`, and `--live-port`) or if their port number part
          is `0`.

          With this option, `lttng-relayd` writes the `control.port`,
          `data.port`, and `live.port` files, as needed, to its runtime
          and configuration directory (`$LTTNG_HOME/.lttng`).

      `--pid-file`:
          Write the process ID (PID) of the `lttng-relayd` process to
          some file (like the `--pidfile` option of lttng-sessiond(8)).

      `--sig-parent`:
          Send the `USR1` signal to the parent process to notify
          readiness (like the `--sig-parent` option
          of `lttng-sessiond`).

    • You can now override the path of the directory where
      `lttng-sessiond` places special files for user space tracing
      applications with the `LTTNG_UST_CTL_PATH` environment variable.

      See lttng-sessiond(8).

    • You can now override the path of the directory where
      `lttng-sessiond` places its control files with the `LTTNG_RUNDIR`
      environment variable.

      See lttng-sessiond(8).

User space tracing specifics:
    • You can now override the path of the directory where a user
      application instrumented with liblttng-ust looks for special
      registration and control files of `lttng-sessiond` with the
      `LTTNG_UST_APP_PATH` environment variable.

      See lttng-ust(3).

    • You can now override the policy used to populate shared memory
      pages within the instrumented application with the
      `LTTNG_UST_MAP_POPULATE_POLICY` environment variable.

      See lttng-ust(3).

    • We improved the memory usage of lttng_ust_tracef()
      and lttng_ust_tracelog().

Kernel tracing specifics:
    The minimum supported Linux kernel version is now 4.4 instead
    of 3.0.

VERSION NAME
━━━━━━━━━━━━
This release is named after "Orbitales", a bold creation from
Noctem Artisans Brasseurs in Québec City.

Pitch black and dense—one team member compared the color to used motor oil—this
beer offers an intriguing sensory experience. Aged in wood casks, it delivers
rich aromas and flavors of blackberry as well as a hint of acidity. There’s no
head to speak of, but a whisper of blue cheese funk lingers just enough to keep
you curious.
