Those test cases are designed to test the support for loading and unloading
probe providers and callsites at run time during tracing. One test case also
tests the event payload comparaison functions.

Testing build artefacts
------------------------

./exec-callsites
	Test binary built with tracepoint callsites only

./exec-probes
	Test binary built with tracepoint probes only

./exec-bare
	Test binary built with no LTTng UST elements

/.libs/libprobe_X.so:
	Libraries containing slight variations of probe providers for the same
	tracepoint name. Note that the file /.libs/libprobes_a_prime.so has the same
	content as .libs/libprobes_a.so likewise for .libs/libprobes_c_prime.so

/.libs/libcallsites_X.so
  Libraries containing only the tracepoint callsites. The user must dlopen the
  library and use dlsym to get an handle on the function that calls the
  tracepoint.

/.libs/libcallsites_probes_X.so
  Libraries containing tracepoint callsites and probe providers. The user must
  dlopen the library and use dlsym to get an handle on the function that calls
  the tracepoint.
