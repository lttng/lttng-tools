UST base address statedump test
-------------------------------

This test verifies that the tracing of base address statedump works
properly. When an application traced with LTTng UST registers to the
session daemon, it should produce a statedump, delimited by `start`
and `end` events. Between those events, the base addresses of the
executable and all the shared objects it has loaded are dumped, along
with extra debug information such as build id or debug link if it
exists.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The test application simply sleeps for one second to ensure the
statedump has the time to complete fully, and defines a single
userspace tracepoint. The statedump events should be generated when
the application registers with the sessiond. The application is
compiled with debug information, which is then copied into a separate
`prog.debug` file, and a debug link section is added to the original
`prog` executable, now stripped of debug information. This ensures
that `lttng_ust_statedump:debug_link` event will be produced. The
events `start`, `bin_info`, `build_id`, and `end` from the same provider
are also expected in the trace and verified by the test.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

To run this test, you will need:

  - lttng-tools (with python bindings)
  - babeltrace
  - python 3.0 or later
