UST dynamic linker tracing test
-------------------------------

This test verifies that the `liblttng-ust-dl.so` helper works as
intended. Indeed, once preloaded, this helper should produce events
for all calls made by the application to dlopen along with with extra
debug information for the given shared object, such as build id or
debug link if it exists, as well as dlclose.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

The test application is run with the environment variable
LD_PRELOAD="liblttng-ust-dl.so" to preload the helper. It then dlopens
a shared library (`libfoo.so`), calls a function from it, and dlclose
it. This should produce `dlopen` and `dlclose` events, as well as
`build_id` and `debug_link`, because the shared library has been built
to contain all this extra debug information.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

To run this test, you will need:

  - lttng-tools (with python bindings)
  - babeltrace
  - python 3.0 or later
