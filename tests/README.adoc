= LTTng-tools Tests

:toc:

== Test harness

The full tests are currently powered via `make check`. Individual tests may
be run directly by calling their respective script. For example:

[,bash]
----
./tests/regression/tools/live/test_ust
----

New tests must be written using the python framework (see `tests/utils/lttngtest`).
The purpose of the `lttngtest` framework is to more reliably control and clean-up
the environment for each test with the eventual long-term goal to be able to
parallelize some of the tests.

Legacy tests are principally written in bash, and some are in C/C++. C/C++ tests
must be limited to those that actually require interacting with loaded libraries
or internal testpoints.

=== Test-related configuration options

 * `PRECIOUS_TESTS`: (Default:{nbsp}yes) When set to  `yes`, test logs will not be deleted after a test failure. This stops tests from being able to automatically rerun with `make check`

== Test Anti-Patterns

OK, there are a few patterns that have been found over and over in the
testing code base which makes the tests flaky. Here is an incomplete
list. Don't do that.


=== Taskset

In some containerised environments, such as Incus, the affinities CPUs
allocated to the container may change during runtime. When using taskset,
there may be a race between selecting a CPU that is currently online and then
running the task itself.

It is important to check for taskset's specific failure, use retries where
appropriate (e.g. `retry_anycpu_taskset`), or have another method to mitigate
potential failures.

This type of issue is rarely seen in local testing, but happens in our CI
cluster.

=== Using pidof to wait for a background application (by name) to disappear

Why is it flaky ?

The application may be delayed after being forked, but not executed yet.
Therefore, pidof will not find it. Use "wait" instead.

=== Using sleep as delay-based optimistic synchronization technique

Why is it flaky ?

Everything that needs to happen before/after other things need to
be explicitly synchronized using e.g. a file (used as a flag).
Sleep is just an indicator of a minimum arbitrary delay, but
machine load and scheduling can actually mess up the real delay
between applications. Use explicit synchronization points. Never
sleep.

=== Using killall on a background application

Why is it flaky ?

Similarly to pidof, killall may run before the background application
executes, thus failing to find it. Store the application PID after it
it launched in background into a temporary variable for later use
by kill and wait.

=== Using wait ${!} to wait for completion of many background applications

Why is it flaky ?

It just waits for the last application put in background. Track the PIDs
of the applications of interest in an array and use a construction similar
to the following to wait for them:

```
## Avoid running `wait ` when the array is empty
if [[ -n "${pids[*]}" ]]; then
   wait "${pids[@]}"`
fi
```

Avoid `wait` without arguments as it will wait for other background
prcesses such as lttng-relayd or lttng-sessiond when they are started
without daemonization.

=== Forgetting wait at the end (or error return path) of a test phase that has background applications

Why is it flaky ?

Those application may interact with the following testing phases,
thus skewing the results.

=== Not grepping into the entire code base for similar patterns

When you find a problematic coding pattern, chances are it appears
elsewhere in the testing code base. Please fix it everywhere!

=== Introducing a utility abstraction without changing all open coded similar code path

When an abstraction for e.g. starting and stopping the session daemon
is introduced as a utility (e.g. utils.sh), future changes will
assume that all the testing code base is using this abstraction.
Leaving a few custom open-coded sites of duplicated code around is a
good way to make it a pain to update the abstraction in the future.
