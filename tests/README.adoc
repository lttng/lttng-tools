= LTTng-tools Tests

:toc:

== Test harness

The full tests are currently powered via `make check`. Individual tests may
be run directly by calling their respective script. For example:

[,bash]
----
./tests/regression/tools/live/test_ust
----

New tests must be written using the python framework (see `tests/utils/lttngtest`).
The purpose of the `lttngtest` framework is to more reliably control and clean-up
the environment for each test with the eventual long-term goal to be able to
parallelize some of the tests.

Legacy tests are principally written in bash, and some are in C/C++. C/C++ tests
must be limited to those that actually require interacting with loaded libraries
or internal testpoints.

=== Test-related configuration options

 * `PRECIOUS_TESTS`: (Default:{nbsp}yes) When set to  `yes`, test logs will not be deleted after a test failure. This stops tests from being able to automatically rerun with `make check`

=== TAP drivers options ===

. Options supported by the various TAP drivers
[cols="1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
| Option | Description | Python tap-driver | BASH tap-driver | C/C++ tap driver

| `LTTNG_TESTS_TAP_AUTOTIME`
| Automatically outputs test step timing information
| {check} | {check} | {check}

| `LTTNG_TEST_LOG_DIR`

=== Test environment variables

. Environment variables support across testing frameworks
[cols="1,1,1,1,1"]

| Environment Variable | Description | Python Framework | Bash Framework | C/C++ Framework

| `LTTNG_ENABLE_DESTRUCTIVE_TESTS`
| When set to `will-break-my-system`, tests that change global state (e.g. clock settings, creating and destroying users, ...) will be run. These tests typically also require being run as the root user.
| {check} | {check} | {ex}

| `LTTNG_RELAYD_ENV_VARS`

| Environment variables to forward into test environment
| {check} | {ex} | {ex}

| `LTTNG_TEST_LOG_DIR`
| Define a directory to which the verbose logs will be written to disk.
`-` may be used to indicate stdout/stderr respectively.
Some invocations of programs during the test may override this value to perform the test.

| `LTTNG_TEST_GDBSERVER_RELAYD_PORT`
| The TCP port for the gdbserver instance. Default:{nbsp}`1025`
| {check} | {check} | {ex}

| `LTTNG_TEST_GDBSERVER_RELAYD_WAIT`
| When not empty, the test script will wait for user input before continuing.
Useful to connect and insert breakpoints before other commands are run.

| `LTTNG_TEST_GDBSERVER_SESSIOND`
| Launch `gdbserver` and attach to newly spawned `lttng-sessiond` processes

| `LTTNG_TEST_NO_RELAYD`
| Do not spawn `lttng-relayd` in test environment
Used to manually launch one during test troubleshooting
| {check} | {ex} | {ex}

| `LTTNG_TEST_GDBSERVER_SESSIOND_PORT`
| The TCP port for the gdbserver instance. Default:{nbsp}`1024`

| `LTTNG_TOOLS_DISABLE_KERNEL_TESTS`
| Do not run kernel (LTTng-modules) tests

== Test Anti-Patterns

OK, there are a few patterns that have been found over and over in the
testing code base which makes the tests flaky. Here is an incomplete
list. Don't do that.


=== Using pidof to wait for a background application (by name) to disappear

Why is it flaky ?

The application may be delayed after being forked, but not executed yet.
Therefore, pidof will not find it. Use "wait" instead.

=== Using sleep as delay-based optimistic synchronization technique

Why is it flaky ?

Everything that needs to happen before/after other things need to
be explicitly synchronized using e.g. a file (used as a flag).
Sleep is just an indicator of a minimum arbitrary delay, but
machine load and scheduling can actually mess up the real delay
between applications. Use explicit synchronization points. Never
sleep.

=== Using killall on a background application

Why is it flaky ?

Similarly to pidof, killall may run before the background application
executes, thus failing to find it. Store the application PID after it
it launched in background into a temporary variable for later use
by kill and wait.

=== Using wait ${!} to wait for completion of many background applications

Why is it flaky ?

It just waits for the last application put in background. Use
"wait" to wait for all background applications.

=== Forgetting wait at the end (or error return path) of a test phase that has background applications

Why is it flaky ?

Those application may interact with the following testing phases,
thus skewing the results.

=== Not grepping into the entire code base for similar patterns

When you find a problematic coding pattern, chances are it appears
elsewhere in the testing code base. Please fix it everywhere!

=== Introducing a utility abstraction without changing all open coded similar code path

When an abstraction for e.g. starting and stopping the session daemon
is introduced as a utility (e.g. utils.sh), future changes will
assume that all the testing code base is using this abstraction.
Leaving a few custom open-coded sites of duplicated code around is a
good way to make it a pain to update the abstraction in the future.
